# Week 4 - Javascript 1

**Instructor notes:**

### Before the lesson, make sure...

* You have gone through the lesson README and know what you need to cover
* The `lesson/starter-code` is zipped and ready to be sent out
* The `homework/starter-code` is zipped and ready to be sent out
* The exercise will be part of the code-along
* The homework brief is ready to be sent out
* You have your desktop space set up and ready to share

### Intro

* Homework review and Recap
* Outline the lesson plan and session outcomes
* Intro slides about current topic

### Code along

* Send out the starter code and make sure everyone has a new VSCode window with the unzipped, open code
* Control the amount of class input: some input makes it more engaging, but too much and you'll fall behind
* Lots of checks for understanding - 90% of the time they won't say a thing, so you can use the following methods:
  * "Out of 5 (5 being the best), show your hands with how well you understand xyz"
  * Ask a random student directly an easy question - putting one on the spot will encourage the class to be more attentive and engaged
* Be aware some students computers are older and / or slower and may have trouble running even lightweight editors. If a browser works, use JSBin or CodePen as a fallback

### Recap

* Start with the simple questions, working your way to more complex, thought provoking ones
* The final questions should lead onto the class exercise (10-20mins)
* Send out and go through the exercise solution-code (10 mins)
* Finish with the summary / checkpoints, then send out the homework starter-code / brief
