## Extended Task:

## NOTES

- When styling multiple pages from one stylesheet, pay special attention to the copmmon elements / classes
- Folder structure, indentation and comments are critical. Everything should be in its right place
- Don't use CSS Frameworks like Bootstrap - we'll be getting to that later
