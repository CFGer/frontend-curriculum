# CSS Homework

## Option 1:
Style both pages of the HTML homework from last week. Feel free to experiment, but keep it organised. You should have the solution code from the homework as a starting point. It could look something like the below images

**index.html**

**./css/page2.html**
![SS2](./resources/ss2.png)

## Option 2:
Recreate, from scratch, the top part of the Code First Girls site

## NOTES
* When styling multiple pages from one stylesheet, pay special attention to the copmmon elements / classes
* Folder structure, indentation and comments are critical. Everything should be in its right place
* Don't use CSS Frameworks like Bootstrap - we'll be getting to that later
