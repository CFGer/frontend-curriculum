> ### Instructor Notes
>
> Send out the _starter-code_ to the students and have them open it in VSCode.

> _IMPORTANT:_ Have them create a new folder either in Desktop or Documents called CodeFirst:Girls, and sub folder called 01_HTML

> File structure should look like

```
CodeFirst:Girls
  |
  |- 01_HTML/
  |----index.html
  |----img/
  |--------img1.jpg
  |--------img2.jpg
  |--------img3.jpg

## Intro

HTML (currently HTML5) stands Hyper Text Markup Language, and was developed to make data more human-readable when the world wide web was in its infancy.

Its job is pure structure (it has basic styling by default which is almost always overw-ridden).

Think of it like a skeleton, or a bookshelf, or a wardrobe: it doesn't have to be pretty but its crucial for layout and organisation.

### Anatomy

1. The `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag

> When our HTML file first hits the browser, this is the first thing that's read and tells the browser to use HTML5 (the latest version)

2. The `<html></html>` tag

> All of our HTML needs to go inside these tags, and falls into 2 places...

3. ...the `<head></head>`...

> This is the 'thinking' part of our HTML, where we can fetch data (CSS, fonts, scripts, JSON, SEO etc). It all gets run 'behind-the-scenes', so to speak

4. ...or the `<body></body>`

> This is where we actually see our content
