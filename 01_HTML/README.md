# Week 1 - HTML

**Instructor notes:**

### Before the lesson, make sure...

* You have gone through the lesson README and know what you need to cover
* The `lesson/starter-code` and the `homework/starter-code` have been shared on the slack channel as zipped files
* You have your desktop space set up and ready to share

### Intro

* Make all the students feel welcome
* Explain the curriculum and CFG's expectations
* Set some ground rules about things like:
  * Asking for help both in and out of class
  * Interupting / disrupting
  * Tardiness
* Outline the lesson plan and session outcomes

### Code along

* Send out the starter code and make sure everyone has a new VSCode window with the unzipped, open code
* Control the amount of class input: some input makes it more engaging, but too much and you'll fall behind
* Lots of checks for understanding - 90% of the time they won't say a thing, so you can use the following methods:
  * "Out of 5 (5 being the best), show your hands with how well you understand xyz"
  * Ask a random student directly an easy question - putting one on the spot will encourage the class to be more attentive and engaged
* Be aware some students computers are older and / or slower and may have trouble running even lightweight editors. If a browser works, use JSBin or CodePen as a fallback

### Recap

* Start with the simple questions, working your way to more complex, thought provoking ones
* Go through the solution for all the exercises
* Finish with the summary / checkpoints, then send out the homework starter-code
